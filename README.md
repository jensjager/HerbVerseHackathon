## App Architecture

The app follows a **modern full-stack architecture**:

1. **Frontend**:

   - Built with **React Native** and **Expo** for cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, and Web).
   - Uses **Expo Router** for file-based navigation.
   - **Tailwind CSS** (via NativeWind) for styling.
   - **Clerk** for authentication and user management.

2. **Backend**:

   - Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
   - **PostgreSQL** as the database, managed via **docker-compose**.
   - RESTful API endpoints for products, orders, and inventory.

3. **State Management**:

   - Context API is used for managing the cart state.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Backend runs in a Dockerized environment.
   - Frontend is designed for deployment on Expo Go or as a standalone app.
